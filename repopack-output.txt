## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

setting up project board and designing the milestones and issues

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

we had some scheduling issues and weren't able to meet up until the last day

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

we were to get the project board setup but haven't started coding yet. we adjusted the milestones deadlines so that we start coding after 11/7 and finish MVP by 11/20

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

the collections feature may be at risk if the book swiping and AI music matching features take longer than expected. we may have to remove some customizability from the app to finish on time

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

we will need support working with the different parts of our tech stack to accomplish our goals while still meeting all the requirements set by CodePath. using the various external APIs may also be challenging to work with for our project's purpose
