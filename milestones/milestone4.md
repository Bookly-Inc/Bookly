## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to complete some issues for our Milestone and understand more about project structure and flow.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We faced a few challenges with scheduling and communication related to the implementation of certain project features. We were also in disagreement over some project tech stack choices but we sorted those out. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished the core feature for this week but had trouble in the backend. The backend logic is more complicated than we estimated so right now we are trying for the MVP (minimum viable product) first.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I would say the mood scoring analysis as it is complex. If we are stuck by the weekends, we will reach out to CodePath for assistance

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

It is hard but I believe we can do it so I don't think we need any particular support.
